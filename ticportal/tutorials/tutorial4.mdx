# Prototype Development (3 months) January - March

> **Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Design**: Design a basic prototype of the solution that demonstrates its core functionalities. <br/> > **Technical Development**: Utilize coding skills, hardware prototyping tools, and design software to build the MVP.<br/> > **Testing & Iteration**: Conduct user testing to gather feedback and iterate on the prototype to improve its usability and effectiveness.<br/>

## Prototyping:

A prototype is an early model of something be it either hardware or software. There are two main types of prototypes; cardboard prototypes and paper prototypes.
Cardboard prototypes: Are you producing a physical three-dimensional invention, building a prototype to begin will be ideal.You can begin by drawing your invention on paper and then using your sketches you can turn it into a physical model using cardboard
Paper prototypes: Suitable for software projects especially mobile apps and webapps. When producing a paper prototype, it is important to take into consideration the user interface, that is include items such as buttons, sliders that enable the users to move from one page of your app or website to another. For mobile apps, the paper prototype must contain all the pages found in the app.
Students with AI inventions can produce paper or cardboard prototypes depending on the type of invention. AI inventions could either be of hardware type or software type.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP):

Before producing your prototype, it will be ideal producing an MVP for a start.
A minimum Viable product is an app, website, AI project or hardware device that has just enough features to satisfy your customers while collecting feedback so that improvements could be done later. It prioritizes only those things that solve the actual problems in the project. For example, to solve the problem of transportation, you could begin by producing a skateboard which solves the problem and then improving your invention by producing a scooter, a bike and later a car. The skateboard in this case is actually your MVP since it is the first product you produced and it has enough features to solve the problem of transportation.

## Prototyping mobile apps

- A mobile app, is a software application designed to run on a mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet. Mobile apps could be built using the MIT app inventor platform or the Thunkable bee platform.If you are thinking about developing a mobile app, there are a few things you should keep in mind:
- Your target audience: Who are you building the app for? What are their needs and wants?
- The app's purpose: What will the app do? What features will it have?
- The app's design: How will the app look and feel? What kind of user experience do you want to create?
- The app's development: How will you develop the app? What programming languages and tools will you use?
- The app's marketing and promotion: How will you get people to download and use your app?

# Prototyping Web apps

A web application is a computer program that utilizes web browsers ( a web browser is a type of software that allows you to find and view websites on the Internet.) and web technology to perform tasks over the Internet.
There are several platforms on which web apps could be built. We have

- **Netlify**:Netlify is a cloud platform that allows you to deploy static websites and web apps. This is a great platform for students who want to build web apps that are simple and easy to deploy.
- **Heroku**:Heroku is a cloud platform that allows you to deploy web apps. This is a great platform for students who want to build web apps that are easy to deploy and scale.
- **Firebase**:Firebase is a mobile platform that provides a variety of services for developing and deploying web apps. This is a great platform for students who want to build scalable and reliable web apps.
- **Figma**:Figma is a web-based interface design tool that consists of powerful and exciting features for web design. This tool provides a collaborative and cost-effective platform for creating fascinating web designs.
  Figma is one of the most preferred platforms for secondary school students to create web apps prototypes. Below is a video that can help you as you create your web app in the figma platform.

## Prototyping AI inventions.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that deals with the creation of intelligent agents, which are systems that can reason, learn, and act autonomously. AI research has been highly successful in developing effective techniques for solving a wide range of problems, from game playing to medical diagnosis.
Teachable machine is the most suitable platform to use when developing an AI invention. It is a web-based platform that allows you to create AI models without any coding. This makes it a great platform for children who are new to programming. Teachable Machine can be used to create a variety of AI projects, such as image recognition systems and chatbots. Below is a video that will guide you as you use theusethe Teachable Machine to create your AI.

### As you produce a prototype, it is ideal you test it's functionality with a few users, then collect feedback and improve upon the invention.
